Are you using WazirX for cryptocurrency trading? If yes, then you know that it only provides the list of crypto that you hold with quantity but did not tell you, that you are in a profit or lose or how your portfolio is doing overtime.  
So you can use this tool to get that details.

Oh, that's great but for this do I have to spin a server and install it?  
If you want you can do that but you can use [this link](https://www.webhat.in/wazirx-portfolio-tracker/), where I have already made it accessible for all the non-technical people.

### Features include:

Track all your crypto assets growth of WazirX exchange in one go. You can filter it or order/sort it based on profit, amount spend, etc.  

Oh, that's great, but I think it is missing this thing, or if you can add this it will make much more sense.
